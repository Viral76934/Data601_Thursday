=> Summary of the Article "50 years of Data Science" explaining what Data Science is:

    In this article, "50 Years of Data Science", the author, David Donoho, discussed both, the history and the future possibilities of the emerging field, "Data Science". The article, in the begining, describes various initiatives conducted in recent years(2015-2017) by various big universities to promote Data Science and a website for one such Data Science Initiative suggested the definition of Data Science as follows: "This coupling of scientific discovery and practice involves the collection, management, processing, analysis, visualization, and interpretation of vast amounts of heterogeneous data associated with a diverse array of scientific, translational, and inter-disciplinary applications."
    In the Tukey Centennial, more than 50 years ago, there was a clash of thoughts regarding the difference between Statistics and Data Science as one school of thought, basically Statisticians, believed that Data Science is just renaming statistics as they both have similar meaning, whereas, on the other hand, statistics was described as a small part of Data Science. To resolve this dilemma, the author brings up the presentaion made at John Tukey centennial, "The Future of Data Analysis", an article published in 1962 in The Annals of Mathematical Statistics where he focused on the need to drastically expand and rethink the scope of statistics and also inferred that statistical theory was only a small part of the new imerging yet little-known science(Data Science). Later on, John Chambers created a language which focused on preparing and presenting new tyoes of data. Also, both Jeff Wu and William Cleveland introduced the name "Data Science" through their lectures and articles resplectively. Later on, around 2001, Leo Breiman, a UC Berkeley statistician divided data analysis into two goals, prediction and inference.
    John Chambers and Bill Cleveland then each envisioned that this field would grow even larger than the consensus data science and evolve into Greater Data Science which consists of six divisions: Data gathering, preparation and exploration; Data Representation and transformation; Computing with data; Data modeling; Data visualization and presentation; and Science about data science.
    In a nutshell, every suggestions of data science involves expanding the statisics and machine learning and the society has already invested huge amount of resources on scientific research, mostly occuring at universities.
